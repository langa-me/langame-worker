Answering this questions may lead us to good discussions on the nature of existence and artificiality of science . We could also find similarities between mathematics and music , which is another topic very related with numbers . The objective here isn't just knowledge; I believe knowing things helps develop reasoning skills , not only memorizing information from books or internet articles. 3. Have you ever heard of prime numbers ? What do they mean ? Prime number s are natural number s greater than 1 whose only positive divisors are itself \u00a0and 1 : 2 , 3 , 5 , 7 , 11 \u2026 A simple way to explain them in a short way: \u00a0prime number s can easily be divided into equal groups without any remainder : 4 = 2 * 2 8 = 4 * 2 16 = 8 * 2 32 = 16*2 64= 32*2 128= 64*32 256=128*16 512=256*32 1024=(256+64)*16 2048=(128+64)*(16\u00d74) 4096=(256+64)(8\u00d74) \u00d7(1+(8)) 2401609600896144000245760000\u2026 So primes look like single unbreakable structures since they cannot be split among several parts (without leaving any remainder). You might ask yourself now: \"What kind of use does having prime number s has?\" One fun thing with prime numbe rs is that they appear all over nature: Primes never repeat themselves so each whole number can be uniquely described using just their digits \u00a0 - No matter how far out one goes in measuring distances along straight lines each distance will always fall under one specific prime \u00a0 - Einstein proved that every atom consists purely out energy"}

Mathematics does not appear to exist; It only seems to exist because humans are able to use their imaginations and mathematical models of reality can predict human behavior accurately as far as we know thus far (our knowledge may change). However, what if those things do not truly represent reality? What if they are simply metaphors for the way things really are, similar to how our dreams allow us to see reality through metaphors that reflect our own inner world rather than outer events happening in time? Perhaps at this point we must ask ourselves: \"What is mathematics?\" Is it merely a metaphor for understanding something more fundamental about the nature of existence such as space and time [and causality] ? Or maybe even consciousness itself...Perhaps these things would be best understood naturally before trying them artificially (i.e., using science/math)? This could help us understand whether math exists outside of brains or whether it's merely an expression of brain activity which happens coincidentally exactly right so that you can figure out stuff like gravity without having millions of years worth of evolution telling you what causes objects fall down when dropped from high places...or whatever else physics can tell you based on your observations...It doesn't seem like inherently accurate descriptions necessarily imply inherent truth/reality either; They just might reflect aspects better than other ones [if this makes sense]. But then again, where did all those concepts come from anyway...? If math is part of a dreamlike metaphor instead, then perhaps its origin will never be known; You'll just keep going around in circles forever until finding new ways to define words feels good or whatever...I don't think anyone wants that kind of life though but maybe it's unavoidable....So yeah I guess my question was fundamentally flawed from the start haha..just kidding I'm not entirely lost here yet! It seems most people who talk about math usually assume its accuracy and therefore try giving logical explanations for why it works although many physicists still admit they don't know why quantum mechanics works - David Deutsch said he thinks consciousness might somehow play into explaining this particular phenomenon but he also believes humanity will never fully comprehend quantum mechanics due possibly due largely because 'consciousness' isn't"}

This fact alone probably makes math \"the driving force\" behind human existence (for example, both language and art are also essential parts of primitive civilizations). Abstract thinking comes naturally as a result (for example, people made geometry long before they had writing), so once civilization becomes sophisticated enough to need more than just food & shelter then there's no way around it - you're forced into abstract thought eventually whether you like it or not...and if your civilization survives long enough without having done so then chances are that you're screwed anyway...so why bother resisting? Of course even today there's nothing wrong with using mental shortcuts (\"intuitions\") when doing things quickly just because \"your gut tells you\" something will work: You don't have time anymore for deep analysis during everyday life unless there isn't any other option anyways - nobody stops their car at red lights anymore either because everybody knows from experience that cars stop by themselves once \"green light\" means 'go'... Moreover science itself shows us clearly where these intuitions come from: Every theory/model etc. works only given certain restrictions (= assumptions) , i.e., every such model consists exactly of those elements which lead logically from given premises (= axioms ) ; everything else must simply be thrown away or considered irrelevant . And indeed most intuition arises due to knowing something firsthand yourself; e g., learning calculus requires actually drawing some curves first before seeing them graphically depicted later on , whereas solving differential equations often involves some idea similar to Newton's method but applied after translating the equation into another form first . In other words practice plays a big role in forming our ideas about nature! But unfortunately many people seem unable or unwilling nowadays even think specifically about physics problems anymore *or* ask questions like posed above...."}
