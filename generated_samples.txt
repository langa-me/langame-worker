 ('. Mathematics does not appear to exist; It only seems to exist because humans are able to use their imaginations and mathematical models of reality can predict human behavior accurately as far as we know thus far (our knowledge may change). However, what if those things do not truly represent reality? What if they are simply metaphors for the way things really are, similar to how our dreams allow us to see reality through metaphors that reflect our own inner world rather than outer events happening in time? Perhaps at this point we must ask ourselves: "What is mathematics?" Is it merely a metaphor for understanding something more fundamental about the nature of existence such as space and time [and causality] ? Or maybe even consciousness itself...Perhaps these things would be best understood naturally before trying them artificially (i.e., using science/math)? This could help us understand whether math exists outside of brains or whether it\'s merely an expression of brain activity which happens coincidentally exactly right so that you can figure out stuff like gravity without having millions of years worth of evolution telling you what causes objects fall down when dropped from high places...or whatever else physics can tell you based on your observations...It doesn\'t seem like inherently accurate descriptions necessarily imply inherent truth/reality either; They just might reflect aspects better than other ones [if this makes sense]. But then again, where did all those concepts come from anyway...? If math is part of a dreamlike metaphor instead, then perhaps its origin will never be known; You\'ll just keep going around in circles forever until finding new ways to define words feels good or whatever...I don\'t think anyone wants that kind of life though but maybe it\'s unavoidable....So yeah I guess my question was fundamentally flawed from the start haha..just kidding I\'m not entirely lost here yet!

 ('. Mathematics does not appear to exist; It only seems to exist because humans are able to use their imaginations and mathematical models of reality can predict human behavior accurately as far as we know thus far(our knowledge may change).However, what if those things do not truly represent reality? What if they are simply metaphors for the way things really are,similar to how our dreams allow us to see reality through metaphors that reflect our own inner world rather than outer events happening in in time? Perhaps at this point we must ask ourselves: "What is mathematics?" Is it merely a metaphor for understanding something more fundamental about the nature of existence such as space and time [and causality] ? Or maybe even consciousness itself...Perhaps these things would be best understood naturally before trying them artificially (i.e., using science/math)? This could help us understand whether math exists outside of brains or whether it\'s merely an expression of brain activity which happens coincidentally exactly right so that you can figure out stuff like gravity without having millions of years worth of evolution telling you what causes objects fall down when dropped from high places...or whatever else physics can tell you based on your observations...It doesn\'t seem like inherently accurate descriptions necessarily imply inherent truth/reality either; They just might reflect aspects better than other ones [if this makes sense]. But then again, where did all those concepts come from anyway...? If math is part of a dreamlike metaphor instead, then perhaps its origin will never be known; You\'ll just keep going around in circles forever until finding new ways to define words feels good or whatever....I don\'t think anyone wants that kind of life though but maybe it\'s unavoidable....So yeah I guess my question was fundamentally flawed from the start haha..just kidding I don\'t mind being talked down to ', ['mathematic']),

 ('. Mathematics does not appear to exist; It only seems to exist because humans are able to use their imaginations and mathematical models of reality can predict human behavior accurately as far as we know thus far (our knowledge may change). However, what if those things do not truly represent reality? What if they are simply metaphors for the way things really are, similar to how our dreams allow us to see reality through metaphors that reflect our own inner world rather than outer events happening in time? Perhaps at this point we must ask ourselves: "What is mathematics?" Is it merely a metaphor for understanding something more fundamental about the nature of existence such as space and time [and causality] ? Or maybe even consciousness itself...Perhaps these things would be best understood naturally before trying them artificially (i.e., using science/math)? This could help us understand whether math exists outside of brains or whether it\'s merely an expression of brain activity which happens coincidentally exactly right so that you can figure out stuff like gravity without having millions of years worth of evolution telling you what causes objects fall down when dropped from high places...or whatever else physics can tell you based on your observations...It doesn\'t seem like inherently accurate descriptions necessarily imply inherent truth/reality either; They just might reflect aspects better than other ones [if this makes sense]. But then again, where did all those concepts come from anyway...? If math is part of a dreamlike metaphor instead, then perhaps its origin will never be known; You\'ll just keep going around in circles forever until finding new ways to define words feels good or whatever...I don\'t think anyone wants that kind of life though but maybe it\'s unavoidable....So yeah I guess my question was fundamentally flawed from the start haha..just kidding I\'m not entirely lost here yet! It seems most people who talk about math usually assume its accuracy and therefore try giving logical explanations for why it works although many physicists still admit they don\'t know why]),

For if every tool either produces its own evil, or can do harm to those for whom it was made, it must also at times harm, or destroy its maker; but natural gifts establishments make all the difference." This theme appeared again at various points throughout history until the mid-[20th] century when the concept of failure in the natural sciences developed and led to a new phenomenon known as "extraterrestrial life".

 ('. Mathematics does not appear to exist; It only seems to exist because humans are able to use their imaginations and mathematical models of reality can predict human behavior accurately as far as we know thus far (our knowledge may change) . However, what if those things do not truly represent reality? What if they are simply metaphors for the way things really are, similar to how our dreams allow us to see reality through metaphors that reflect our own inner world rather than outer events happening in time? Perhaps at this point we must ask ourselves: "What is mathematics?" Is it merely a metaphor for understanding something more fundamental about the nature of existence such as space and time [and causality] ? Or maybe even consciousness itself...Perhaps these things would be best discovered naturally before trying them artificially (i.e., using science/math)? This could help us understand whether math exists outside of brains or whether it\'s merely an expression of brain activity which happens coincidentally exactly right so that you can figure out stuff like gravity without having millions of years worth of evolution telling you what causes objects fall down when dropped from high places...or whatever else physics can tell you based on your observations...It doesn\'t seem like inherently accurate descriptions necessarily imply inherent truth/reality either; They just might reflect aspects better than other ones [if this makes sense].

This is a tricky question and under my perspective are the two newest ways to study this question : First , do we have an algorithm for testing if a computer can think or not ? We already have such an algorythm and here it is : Say I give you the burden of finding a mate in time T served while getting more and more attracted to another random person walking by but you don\'t know yet when T will be fulfilled . Searching inside a computer yourself you would answer: Perhaps another scenerio where I take advantage of certain characteristics of people I like (eyes , hair , IQ ) but maybe now other attributes such as age and gender also matter ; Or perhaps memories (that must be some smarty manipulating things when they generate memories over time ) override primitive feelings such as attraction .
