quote ### Two big things cause me so much anxiety, that  sometimes I wonder if they are related to each other: The huge amount of redundancy in my existence I possibly can't avoid or maybe even significantly reduce; The possibility that my work and efforts have no substantial meaning. And as any stereotype has a reflex, there must be other 'macrocosmic' concerns standing out to many people: Break your fast on the day of killed helpless dude seems just like a silly exercise in inhumanity, decadence and playboy primitivism; Killing tens of thousands for kicks in auto-exploitation and in few numbers is often allowed by large groups who don't really identify with potential dead bodies occuring from war induced traumas. But still, these concerns stand on one side; there is more!

Like the Census conducted by IRS to identify tax evaders works really fine till you bring it into non-invertisial property or say our food deserts where personal information comes into play and it's almost impossible to hold individuals accountable without causing any harm(to whom?). Now thinking in opposite way our Mass Media as an 'art form' is also excepting some flaws since any goon with enough bucks can have his way, showing off with pointless bias & stereotypes what makes them rich! Now personally I remember my History lessons where all they teach us is how a nation won a war & strictly doing noting por that.
