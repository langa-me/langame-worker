Instead of returning a response, this simple API will just make a note to myself that "I need to calculate that one next. I'll finish up in a second!". The API does this because, unlike a comparable formula of using cache managers, the heavy calculations needed for arithmetic last for an indeterminate amount of time—it can really be a handful! Hopefully relying on the API's returned "I have not yet calculated it" phrase isn't too much of an inconvenience for you. If it is, please compile your request into x + y where x and y are positive integers and get in touch with me at https://github.com/ethantkoenig/.
