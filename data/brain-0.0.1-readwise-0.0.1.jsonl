He personally defines the functional and performance specifications, designs the program, codes it, tests it, and writes its documentation (Page\u00a045)\n- The copilot. He is the alter ego of the surgeon, able to do any part of the job, but is less experienced. His main function is to share in the design as a thinkerrdiscussant, and evaluator. The surgeon tries ideas on him, but is not bound by his advice. The copilot often represents his team in discussions of function and interface with other teams. He knows all the code intimately. He researches alternative design strategies. He obviously serves as insurance against disaster to the surgeon. He may even write code, but he is not responsible for any part of the code (Page\u00a045)\n- The editor. The surgeon is responsible for generating the documentation\u2014for maximum clarity he must write it. This is true of both external and internal descriptions. The editor, however, takes the draft or dictated manuscript produced by the surgeon and criticizes it, reworks it, provides it with references and bibliography, nurses it through several versions, and oversees the mechanics of production (Page\u00a046)\n- Two secretaries. The administrator and the editor will each need a secretary; the administrator's secretary will handle project correspondence and non-product files (Page\u00a046)\n- The program clerk. He is responsible for maintaining all the technical records of the team in a programming-product library. The clerk is trained as a secretary and has responsibility for both machine-readable and human-readable files (Page\u00a046)\n- The toolsmith. File-editing, text-editing, and interactive debugging services are now readily available, so that a team will rarely need its own machine and machine-operating crew. But these services must be available with unquestionably satisfactory response and reliability; and the surgeon must be sole judge of the adequacy of the service available to him. He needs a toolsmith, responsible for ensuring this adequacy of the basic service and for constructing, maintaining, and upgrading special tools\u2014mostly interactive computer services\u2014needed by his team. Each team will need its own toolsmith, regardless of the excellence and reliability of any centrally provided service, for his job is to see to the tools needed or wanted by his surgeon, without regard to any other team's needs. The tool-builder will often construct specialized utilities, catalogued procedures, macro libraries (Page\u00a047)\n- The tester. The surgeon will need a bank of suitable test cases for testing pieces of his work as he writes it, and then for testing the whole thing. The tester is therefore both an adversary who devises system test cases from the functional specs, and an assistant who devises test data for the day-by-day debugging. He would also plan testing sequences and set up the scaffolding required for component tests (Page\u00a047)\n- The language lawyer can 6nd a neat and efficient way to use the language to do difficult, obscure, or tricky things. Often he will need to do small studies (two or three days) on good technique. One language lawyer can service two or three surgeons (Page\u00a048)\n\n###\n"}

The Special Theory confers upon light, or rather upon the speed of light in a vacuum, a unique role in the space-time structure. It is often said that this speed constitutes an absolute physical limit which cannot be broached. If so, then no relativistic theory can permit instantaneous effects or causal processes. We must therefore regard with grave suspicion anything thought to outpace light. The quantum connection appears to violate this fundamental law (Page\u00a023)\n- When we locate an event in the world we need to specify four coordinates: three to give the location and one to give the time (Page\u00a032)\n- Newton\u2019s first Law of Motion reads: Every body continues in its state of rest, or of uniform motion in a right line, unless it is compelled to change that state by forces impressed on it (Page\u00a035)\n- A body subject to a force will occupy a curved trajectory, and Newton\u2019s second Law states exactly how the path will curve. Acceleration of a body is nothing more than the curvature of its trajectory through space-time (Page\u00a035)\n- Henceforth space by itself, and time by itself, are doomed to fade away into mere shadows, and only a kind of union of the two will preserve an independent reality (Page\u00a051)\n- We can now understand one of the most famous relativistic effects: time dilation. A clock is judged to run slower in a frame of reference in which it is moving than the clocks at rest in that frame. As with the Lorentz-Fitzgerald contraction, the most puzzling aspect of the phenomenon is its symmetry: each of the two relatively moving clocks (in its frame) judges the other to be running slow (Page\u00a052)\n- A test of how well one has internalized the spirit of Relativity is how one is tempted to answer the question: what would it be like to travel at 99.99 percent the speed of light? A bad answer: due to the Lorentz-Fitzgerald contraction and to time dilation, one would feel squashed flat as a pancake and see time passing very slowly. A marginally better answer: one would indeed be squashed flat as a pancake and one\u2019s clocks would be running slowly, but this would not be noticeable. For one\u2019s meter sticks would have shrunk proportionally, and so (Page\u00a053)\n- A test of how well one has internalized the spirit of Relativity is how one is tempted to answer the question: what would it be like to travel at 99.99 percent the speed of light?

A marginally better answer: one would indeed be squashed flat as a pancake and one\u2019s clocks would be running slowly, but this would not be noticeable (Page\u00a053)\n- Given that only finite amounts of energy are available, it would follow that no particle which travels below the speed of light can ever be accelerated to, or beyond, that speed. So the speed of light does serve as a limit on the velocities of particles which start out traveling at sublight speeds (Page\u00a063)\n- 1 1 Finger Exercise: Superluminal Matter Transport 63 + = \u239b \u239c 1 \u2212 V \u239e \u2212 1 1 V 2 2 \u239f = \u239b \u239c (1 \u2212 V 2 ) 2 \u239e \u2212 2 = V 2 1 V 2 \u23a0 \u239d (1 V 2 ) 2 \u239f \u2212 \u239d + + \u23a0 1 1 \u239b \u239c 1 \u2212 2V 2 + V 4 \u239e \u2212 2 2 \u2212 2 \u239d 2 4 \u239f = \u239b 1 4V 1 2V V \u23a0 \u239c \u2212 \u239e = + + \u239d 1 + 2V 2 + V 4 \u239f \u23a0 1 \u2212 (1 2 2 \u2212 W ) . Since we have been using natural units, our final result is that if the rest mass of a particle is m0, then the mass attributed to it in a frame of reference in which it is moving at velocity v is m 0 (1 \u2212 v 2 /c 2 )\u2212 12 : the mass scales by the same factor \u03b3 which appears in the Lorentz transformation. In a given frame, then, as the velocity of a particle increases so does its mass.Furthermore, as the velocity approaches the speed of light, the mass approaches infinity, and hence it requires unbounded amounts of energy to get the particle to go faster. Given that only finite amounts of energy are available, it would follow that no particle which travels below the speed of light can ever be accelerated to, or beyond, that speed. So the speed of light does serve as a limit on the velocities of particles which start out traveling at sublight speeds (Page\u00a063)\n- In a given frame, then, as the velocity of a particle increases so does its mass.Furthermore, as the velocity approaches the speed of light, the mass approaches infinity, and hence it requires unbounded amounts of energy to get the particle to go faster.

So the speed of light does serve as a limit on the velocities of particles which start out traveling at sublight speeds. (Page\u00a063)\n- The Lorentz transformations and the relativistic mass increase do not per se rule out superluminal particles (tachyons), but only prohibit the acceleration of particles through the light barrier. Tachyons must be born traveling faster than light and (as we will see) cannot be slowed to sublight speeds. But how are we to determine the properties of tachyons? (Page\u00a065)\n- The first is that backward causation, like the motion of particles backward in time, may introduce insurmountable problems into our physical theory. The other is that the physical structure may, at base, no longer be Lorentz invariant. If there is some unique frame of reference in which causes always precede effects then that frame has a claim to preferred status. If Nature transacts her business in one coordinate system rather than any other, the Principle of Relativity is more illusion than insight (Page\u00a072)\n- As Bell notes, \u201cto answer this we need at least a schematic theory of what we can do, a fragment of a theory of human beings\u201d (1987, p. 60 (Page\u00a075)\n- The case of wave collapse is more subtle. It is most easily illustrated by considering a special case, such as our two correlated photons. When the pair is created, quantum theory describes it using a so-called entangled state (Page\u00a079)\n- which displays perfect correlation of results on the two wings when the polarization is measured in the same direction (Page\u00a080)\n- we proved a special case of Bell\u2019s theorem for an experimental arrangement which displays perfect correlation of results on the two wings when the polarization is measured in the same direction (Page\u00a080)\n- The principle of local causality states that all of the causes of an event must lie in its past light cone. In a locally causal world, the events in region 1 cannot directly influence the events in region 2 or vice versa (Page\u00a082)\n- What locality does exclude, however, is the possibility that the preparation of either measuring device can exert a causal influence on the other subsystem so as to affect the probabilities for the possible outcomes of measurements performed on that other subsystem. Since these two events, the preparation of one measuring device in a given state and the measurement executed by the other measuring device, can be space-like related, locality is a requirement of relativity theory (Page\u00a088)\n- Locality\u201d in Howard\u2019s usage requires that the physical state of a system \u201cis unaffected by events in regions of the universe so removed from the given system that no signal could connect them (Page\u00a089)\n- Those interested in the complexities involved in a counterfactual analysis of causation can do no better than David Lewis\u2019 \u201cCausation\u201d (1986, pp. 159\u2013213) (Page\u00a0116)\n- it is a limit on the velocity of energy transmission, of signal speed, of causal connection and of information transmission (Page\u00a0173)\n- In any orthodox theory the wavefunction is complete and hence must collapse, so we must consider whether collapses could be generated in a relativistically invariant way. (Page\u00a0178)\n- In Euclidean geometry all triangles have interior angles equal to two right angles; straight lines meet at most once; and every direction in space determines a collection of parallel lines which never meet, keeping ever a constant distance from one another (Page\u00a0206)\n\n###\n"}

We cannot, therefore, answer questions of this kind at all, but only state their senselessness. Most questions and propositions of the philosophers result from the fact that we do not understand the logic of our language. They are of the same kind as the question whether the Good is more or less identical than the Beautiful (Page\u00a01)\n- What is complex in the world is a fact. Facts which are not compounded of other facts are what Mr Wittgenstein calls Sachverhalte, whereas a fact which may consist of two or more facts is called a Tatsache: thus, for example, \u2018Socrates is wise\u2019 is a Sachverhalt, as well as a Tatsache, whereas \u2018Socrates is wise and Plato is his pupil\u2019 is a Tatsache but not a Sachverhalt (Page\u00a01)\n- Mr Wittgenstein begins his theory of Symbolism with the statement (2.1): \u2018We make to ourselves pictures of facts. \u2019 A picture, he says, is a model of the reality, and to the objects in the reality correspond the elements of the picture: the picture itself is a fact.

In reality he is quite a superficial person or, as is mostly the case, a conceited simpleton whose good intentions cannot make up for his incompetence in practical affairs. The art of leadership, as displayed by really great popular leaders in all ages, consists in consolidating the attention of the people against a single adversary and taking care that nothing will split up that attention into sections. The more the militant energies of the people are directed towards one objective the more will new recruits join the movement, attracted by the magnetism of its unified action, and thus the striking power will be all the more enhanced. The leader of genius must have the ability to make different opponents appear as if they belonged to the one category; for weak and wavering natures among a leader\u2019s following may easily begin to be dubious about the justice of their own cause if they have to face different enemies. As soon as the vacillating masses find themselves facing an opposition that is made up of different groups of enemies their sense of objectivity will be aroused and they will ask how is it that all the others can be in the wrong and they themselves, and their movement, alone in the right. Such a feeling would be the first step towards a paralysis of their fighting vigour. Where there are various enemies who are split up into divergent groups it will be necessary to block them all together as forming one solid front, so that the mass of followers in a popular movement may see only one common enemy against whom they have to fight. Such uniformity intensifies their belief in the justice of their own cause and strengthens their feeling of hostility towards the opponent. The Pan-German Movement was unsuccessful because the leaders did not grasp the significance of that truth. They saw the goal clearly and their intentions were right; but they took the wrong road. Their action may be compared to that of an Alpine climber who never loses sight of the peak he wants to reach, who has set out with the greatest determination and energy, but pays no attention to the road 102 (Page\u00a0102)\n- Marriage is not an end in itself but must serve the greater end, which is that of increasing and maintaining the human species and the race. This is its only meaning and purpose. This being admitted, then it is clear that the institution of marriage must be judged by the manner in which its allotted function is fulfilled. Therefore early marriages should be the rule, because thus the young couple will still have that pristine force which is the fountain head of a healthy posterity with unimpaired powers of resistance. Of course early marriages cannot be made the rule unless a whole series of social measures are first undertaken without which early marriages cannot be even thought of . In other words, a solution of this question, which seems a small problem in itself, cannot be brought about without adopting radical measures to alter the social background. The importance of such measures ought to be studied and properly estimated, especially at a time when the so-called \u2018social\u2019 Republic has shown itself unable to solve the housing problem and thus has made it impossible for innumerable couples to get married. That sort of policy prepares the way for the further advance of prostitution. Another reason why early marriages are impossible is our nonsensical method of regulating the scale of salaries, which pays far too little attention to the problem of family support. Prostitution, therefore, can only be really seriously tackled if, by means of a radical social reform, early marriage is made easier than hitherto. This is the first preliminary necessity for the solution of this problem. Secondly, a whole series of false notions must be eradicated from our system of bringing up and educating children - things which hitherto no one seems to have worried about. In our present educational system a balance will have to be established, first and foremost, between mental instruction and physical training. What is known as Gymnasium (Grammar School) to-day is a positive insult to the Greek institution. Our system of education entirely loses sight of the fact that in the long run a healthy mind can exist only in a healthy body. This statement, with few exceptions, applies particularly to the broad masses of the nation. In the pre-War Germany there was a time when no one took the trouble to think over this truth. Training of the body was criminally neglected, the one-sided 199 (Page\u00a0199)\n- of genius all the sacrifices would not have been in vain. It was probably the very parliamentarian skill displayed by the chief of the navy during the years of peace which later became the cause of the fatal collapse, since parliamentarian considerations had begun to play a more important role in the construction of the navy than fighting considerations. The irresolution, the weakness and the failure to adopt a logically consistent policy, which is typical of the parliamentary system, contaminated the naval authorities. As I have already emphasized, the military authorities did not allow themselves to be led astray by such fundamentally erroneous ideas. Ludendorff, who was then a Colonel in the General Staff, led a desperate struggle against the criminal vacillations with which the Reichstag treated the most vital problems of the nation and in most cases voted against them. If the fight which this officer then waged remained unsuccessful this must be debited to the Parliament and partly also to the wretched and weak attitude of the Chancellor, Bethmann-Hollweg. Yet those who are responsible for Germany\u2019s collapse do not hesitate now to lay all the blame on the shoulders of the one man who took a firm stand against the neglectful manner in which the interests of the nation were managed. But one falsehood more or less makes no difference to these congenital tricksters. Anybody who thinks of all the sacrifices which this nation has had to bear, as a result of the criminal neglect of those irresponsible individuals; anybody who thinks of the number of those who died or were maimed unnecessarily; anybody who thinks of the deplorable shame and dishonour which has been heaped upon us and of the illimitable distress into which our people are now plunged - anybody who realizes that in order to prepare the way to a few seats in Parliament for some unscrupulous place-hunters and arrivists will understand that such hirelings can be called by no other name than that of rascal and criminal; for otherwise those words could have no meaning. In comparison with traitors who betrayed the nation\u2019s trust every other kind of twister may be looked upon as an honourable man. It was a peculiar feature of the situation that all the real faults of the old Germany were exposed to the public gaze only when the inner solidarity of the nation could be injured by doing so. Then, indeed, unpleasant truths were openly proclaimed in the ears of the broad masses, while many other things were at other times shamefully hushed up or their existence simply denied, especially at times when an open discussion of such problems might have led to an improvement in their regard. The higher government authorities knew little or nothing of the nature and use of propaganda in such matters. Only the Jew knew 215 (Page\u00a0215)\n\n###\n"}

Why is there something rather than nothing? What shaped the fundamental laws of physics? What is consciousness, and where does it come from? We do not know the answers to these questions, and we give our ignorance the grand name of God. The most fundamental characteristic of this mysterious God is that we cannot say anything concrete about Him. This is the God of the philosophers; the God we talk about when we sit around a campfire late at night, and wonder what life is all about. On other occasions people see God as a stern and worldly lawgiver, about whom we know only too much. We know exactly what He thinks about fashion, food, sex and politics, and we invoke this Angry Man in the Sky to justify a million regulations, decrees and conflicts. He gets upset when women wear short-sleeved shirts, when two men have sex with one another, or when teenagers masturbate. Some people say He does not like us to ever drink alcohol, whereas according to others He positively demands that we drink wine every Friday night or every Sunday morning. Entire libraries have been written to explain in the minutest details exactly what He wants and what He dislikes. The most fundamental characteristic of this worldly lawgiver is that we can say extremely concrete things about Him. This is the God of the crusaders and jihadists, of the inquisitors, the misogynists and the homophobes. This is the God we talk about when we stand around a burning pyre, hurling stones and abuses at the heretics being grilled there.

Given a 10 percent chance of a one hundred\u2013times payoff, you should take that bet every time. But you\u2019re still going to be wrong nine times out of ten. We all know that if you swing for the fences, you\u2019re going to strike out a lot, but you\u2019re also going to hit some home runs. The difference between baseball and business, however, is that baseball has a truncated outcome distribution. When you swing, no matter how well you connect with the ball, the most runs you can get is four. In business, every once in a while, when you step up to the plate, you can score 1,000 runs. This long-tailed distribution of returns is why it\u2019s important to be bold.

This is the young generation. For them, do I line up, get stuck in traffic, buy a 300 renminbi ticket and get stuck in an auditorium? Or can I do that for 100 bucks and look like a king online? So the time has changed, and therefore, if you have users, any company should try to monetize through various ways.

Watch yourself, but don\u2019t become self-centered in that watching. Be tremendously concerned, in watching, about further enlargement of yourself (Page\u00a0244)\n- thought which the Greeks imposed upon the West, with their political philosophy, with their mathematics, and so on. Thought has not found an answer and it never will. So we must go then into the whole structure of thought and the content that it has created as consciousness. We must observe the operation of thought in relationship, in our daily life. That observation implies having an insight as to whether it is a fact that the observer is different from the observed, for if there is a difference there must inevitably be conflict, just as there is between two ideologies. Ideologies are the inventions of thought, conditioned by the culture in which they have developed (Page\u00a0285)\n- Then, through negation of what is false\u2014not through resistance or reaction to the false\u2014through choiceless rejection of what is false, you have a different kind of energy (Page\u00a0291)\n- Attachment gives a certain occupation to the mind; you constantly think about something. The brain and the mind say, \u201cI must be occupied with something\u201d\u2014with my god, with my sex, with my drink; \u201cI must be occupied\u201d\u2014 with the kitchen, or with some social order, or commune, or whatever it is. Out of this demand for occupation there is attachment, holding on to something. Why must the mind be so occupied? What would happen if it were not so occupied? Would it go astray? Would it disintegrate? Would it feel utterly naked, empty (Page\u00a0291)\n- So the question arises: Is the mind mechanical? That is, in your mind, are your thoughts, your feelings, your reactions, your responsibilities, your relationships, your ways, your opinions, and so on, merely mechanical; that is, responding according to conditioning, according to environmental influence? If that is the totality of the mind, then we live in a tremendous, inescapable prison (Page\u00a0295)\n- And it is stupid: just to go to the office, to earn money, to take responsibility, to struggle, compete, worry, to despair, to have anxieties, immense sorrows, and then die. We say that is not good enough. We may put it more philosophically, in more extravagant or romantic language, but we see it is stupid and we want something more. Then we say: \u201cHow are we to cross this river to the other shore?\u201d We ask, \u201cWho will take us across?\u201d When we ask that question, there is the priest, the guru, the man who knows, and he says, \u201cFollow me\u201d\u2014and then we are done, because he is exactly like us, because he still functions within the field of thought. He has created the gods, Jesus, Buddha, Krishna (Page\u00a0297)\n- As long as there is a center, the \u201cme\u201d or the idea of the \u201cme,\u201d with all its attachments, that very center creates a space around itself. Where there is a center, there must be a border. The border may be extended, but it is still limited by the space that the center has created. Meditation means to come upon that space in which there is no center; therefore, no direction; therefore, no time. Without meditation and the coming upon that thing which is not able to be experienced, which is not to be put into words, which has no time, which has no continuity, life has very little meaning. You may have a lot of money, or no money; you may be attached to your property, to your wife, to your friend, or you may worship your particular little god, which thought has invented, but as long as you live there, there will be suffering, pain, anxiety, and violence. And that has no meaning in itself, obviously. Only when you come upon this space\u2014 not invent it, not project it, not bring it about through any system\u2014then only does life have an extraordinary sense of beauty and meaning. Saanen (Page\u00a0308)\n- There is knowledge of the present only when there is a complete understanding of what the structure and the nature of the past is\u2014and ending it.

Say you are envious of people, how do you look at that envy? Are you looking at it as an observer who is different from envy? You look at it as though you are separate from envy, but the fact is that you are envy. You are not the observer who is different; the observer himself is that. So the observer is the observed. Please, this is really very important to understand. When you have grasped the truth that the observer is the observed, then that which is observed undergoes radical change. What prevents a radical change of what is is the interference of the observer, who is the past. To understand this removes all conflict.

In practice, scale and new features keep SREs on their toes. (Page\u00a06)\n- SREs should receive a maxi\u2010 mum of two events per 8\u201312-hour on-call shift. This target volume gives the on-call engineer enough time to handle the event accurately and quickly, clean up and restore normal service, and then conduct a postmortem (Page\u00a08)\n- Postmortems should be written for all significant incidents, regardless of whether or not they paged; postmortems that did not trigger a page are even more valuable, as they likely point to clear monitoring gaps. This investigation should establish what happened in detail, find all root causes of the event, and assign actions to correct the problem or improve how it is addressed next time. Google operates under a blamefree postmortem culture, with the goal of exposing faults and applying engineering to fix these faults, rather than avoiding or minimizing them. (Page\u00a08)\n- Monitoring is one of the primary means by which service owners keep track of a sys\u2010 tem\u2019s health and availability. As such, monitoring strategy should be constructed thoughtfully. A classic and common approach to monitoring is to watch for a specific value or condition, and then to trigger an email alert when that value is exceeded or that condition occurs. However, this type of email alerting is not an effective solution: a system that requires a human to read an email and decide whether or not some type of action needs to be taken in response is fundamentally flawed. Monitoring should never require a human to interpret any part of the alerting domain. Instead, software should do the interpreting, and humans should be notified only when they need to take action.

(Page\u00a024)\n- the more likely it is to be toil: Manual This includes work such as manually running a script that automates some task. Running a script may be quicker than manually executing each step in the script, but the hands-on time a human spends running that script (not the elapsed time) is still toil time. Repetitive If you\u2019re performing a task for the first time ever, or even the second time, this work is not toil. Toil is work you do over and over. If you\u2019re solving a novel prob\u2010 lem or inventing a new solution, this work is not toil. Automatable If a machine could accomplish the task just as well as a human, or the need for the task could be designed away, that task is toil. If human judgment is essential for the task, there\u2019s a good chance it\u2019s not toil. 3 Tactical Toil is interrupt-driven and reactive, rather than strategy-driven and proactive. Handling pager alerts is toil. We may never be able to eliminate this type of work completely, but we have to continually work toward minimizing it. No enduring value If your service remains in the same state after you have finished a task, the task was probably toil. If the task produced a permanent improvement in your ser\u2010 vice, it probably wasn\u2019t toil, even if some amount of grunt work\u2014such as digging into legacy code and configurations and straightening them out\u2014was involved.O(n) with service growth If the work involved in a task scales up linearly with service size, traffic volume, or user count, that task is probably toil. An ideally managed and designed service can grow by at least one order of magnitude with zero additional work, other than some one-time efforts to add resources (Page\u00a050)\n- The Four Golden Signals The four golden signals of monitoring are latency, traffic, errors, and saturation. If you can only measure four metrics of your user-facing system, focus on these four. Latency The time it takes to service a request. It\u2019s important to distinguish between the latency of successful requests and the latency of failed requests. For example, an HTTP 500 error triggered due to loss of connection to a database or other critical backend might be served very quickly; however, as an HTTP 500 error indicates a failed request, factoring 500s into your overall latency might result in mislead\u2010 ing calculations. On the other hand, a slow error is even worse than a fast error! Therefore, it\u2019s important to track error latency, as opposed to just filtering out errors. Trafc A measure of how much demand is being placed on your system, measured in a high-level system-specific metric. For a web service, this measurement is usually HTTP requests per second, perhaps broken out by the nature of the requests (e.g., static versus dynamic content). For an audio streaming system, this meas\u2010 urement might focus on network I/O rate or concurrent sessions. For a key-value storage system, this measurement might be transactions and retrievals per second. Errors The rate of requests that fail, either explicitly (e.g., HTTP 500s), implicitly (for example, an HTTP 200 success response, but coupled with the wrong content), or by policy (for example, \u201cIf you committed to one-second response times, any request over one second is an error\u201d). Where protocol response codes are insuffi\u2010 cient to express all failure conditions, secondary (internal) protocols may be nec\u2010 essary to track partial failure modes. Monitoring these cases can be drastically different: catching HTTP 500s at your load balancer can do a decent job of catch\u2010 ing all completely failed requests, while only end-to-end system tests can detect that you\u2019re serving the wrong content. Saturation How \u201cfull\u201d your service is. A measure of your system fraction, emphasizing the resources that are most constrained (e.g., in a memory-constrained system, show memory; in an I/O-constrained system, show I/O). Note that many systems degrade in performance before they achieve 100% utilization, so having a utiliza\u2010 tion target is essential. In complex systems, saturation can be supplemented with higher-level load measurement: can your service properly handle double the traffic, handle only 10% more traffic, or handle even less traffic than it currently receives?

World history, in fact, has advanced through the categories, from Pure Being in China (of which Hegel knew nothing except that it was) to the Absolute Idea, which seems to have been nearly, if not quite, realized in the Prussian State. I cannot see any justification, on the basis of his own metaphysic, for the view that world history repeats the transitions of the dialectic, yet that is the thesis which he developed in his Philosophy of History. ~ [[Russell]]\n\n> La pathologie de l'id\u00e9e est dans l'**id\u00e9alisme**, o\u00f9 l'id\u00e9e occulte la r\u00e9alit\u00e9 qu'elle a mission de traduire et se prend pour seule ~ [[Edgar Morin]]\n###\n"}

They are products of System 1. ~ [[Kahnemann]]\n\n\nIt is not a surprise as very few research is done in that area and it's not even taught at [[School]].\n\nIt is one of the reason I am extremely [[Skepticism|skeptical]] about the [[Information|information]] I consume, especially when it is about science, they see **causality** everywhere, resulting in false beliefs among the herd.\n\nThus, I avoid like the plague documentaries (I do not consume video content anyway), everything \"scientific\", they look at a few curves, a few anecdotes and say, **CAUSALITY**. White papers are a much safer source, but still ridden with errors, often, in the end, only the [[Philosophy/Mind/Mental Model/Lindy Effect]] can save us, only the test of time can reveal **causal** links.\n\n>Of the first kind are resemblance, contrariety, degrees in quality, and proportions in or number. But spatio-temporal and **causal** relations are of the second kind Only relations of the first kind give certain [[Philosophy/Epistemology/Knowledge]]; our discerning the others is only probable. Algebra and arithmetic are the only #science. [[Geometry]] is not so certain as algebra and arithmetic, because we cannot be sure of the truth of its axioms ~ [[Russell]]\n\n#to-digest \n\n[[Russell]] say, taking the point of view of [[Hume]],\n>Through [[Association]], if A and B have been constantly conjoined in past experience, the impression of A produces that lively idea of B which constitutes belief in B\n\n[[Association]] gives the feeling of [[Mathematic/Causality/Causality]]? But not necessarily **causal**?\n\n>[[Hume]] had proved that the law of **causality** is not [[Analytic]] ~ [[Russell]]\n\nThere cannot, in [[Wittgenstein]]'s logic, be any such thing as a causal nexus. \"The events of the future,\" he says, \"cannot be inferred from those of the present. Superstition is the belief in the **causal** nexus.\" That the sun will rise to-morrow is a hypothesis. We do not in fact know whether it will rise, since there is no compulsion according to which one thing must happen because another happens.\n\n>I would rather discover one **causal** law than be King of Persia.\n~\u00a0[[Democritus]] (460-370 B.C.)\n###\n"}

In this way we arrive at the proposition which is ordinarily represented in mathematical logic by the words **fx is false for all values of x**.

This means that if a man has any sense he will take care to weigh the pros and cons, avoiding pleasure if the pain it involves seems likely to predominate, and accepting pain if the inherent pleasure is going to outweigh the disadvantage ~ [[Russell]]\n\nOr in other words, maximize positively asymmetric events.\n\n![[Pasted image 20210627095432.png]]\n\n> Eat little, for fear of indigestion; drink little, for fear of next morning; eschew politics and love and all violently passionate activities; do not give hostages to fortune by marrying and having children; in your mental life, teach yourself to contemplate pleasures rather than pains. Physical pain is certainly a great evil, but if severe, it is brief, and if prolonged, it can be endured by means of mental discipline and the habit of thinking of happy things in spite of it. Above all, live so as to avoid fear ~ [[Epicurus]]\n\nEven [[Socrates]] support this idea,\n\n>...avoid extremes either of joy or grief...\n\nWhy this is known for thousand years, but still not applied by society stay a mystery to me.\n\n# Anti model\n\nThe [[Anti model]] of this, is what most people do on week ends, drinking and eating a lot, because it is highly short-term rewarding, but this is a negative asymmetry, the negative effects will outweighs the positive ones.

{"prompt": "The dream of Episteme:", "completion": " #mind \n\n\nA thick fog made the atmosphere around them opaque, as did the men's thoughts, wandering in the unknown and uncertain, never finding satisfaction.\n\nThe heavy humid air made their movements stiff and their minds sluggish. The fog was so dense that the men could hardly see the end of their noses.\n\nBut Episteme, for his part, was moving forward with his eyes closed, sure of himself.  An aura of confidence surrounded him. He was sure of himself. He was sure of the world, and of himself.\n\nThe world was a perfect place. It was a beautiful world. The sky was blue, the sun was yellow. The sun was warm and bright, and it would soon be going down, slowly setting behind a range of mountains, a range that looked like a woman's profile.\n\nThe mountains were purple with pine trees. The pine trees were tall and stately, and their needles were green and soft to the touch.\n\nThe sun was still high in the sky, though it was going down. The sun was warm, but Episteme knew it would soon be cold. He knew the mountains would soon be covered with snow. He knew the pine trees would soon be bare of needles.\n\nThe men around him were not sure of anything. They were not sure of where they were going. They were not sure of what to do next. They were not sure of anything. They did not know where to go or what to do next. They did not know anything at all.\n\nEpisteme was sure of everything. He knew everything. He thought he knew everything, but he did not know the truth. He knew nothing of the truth, nothing at all of the truth. The truth was something he could never know, something he would never find out, something he would never understand.\n\nThey walked in silence for a while, each lost in his thoughts, lost in his own private world, each lost in his own private hell. Each was lost in his own private purgatory, trapped in his own private hell forevermore. Each was doomed to live out his days in total ignorance, doomed to live out his days without ever knowing the truth. \n\nHe descended the hard and rocky way, although he saw no one on it. He knew what it was to be lonely, and for this reason he was kindly and gentle with every one.\n\nHe dwelt in the cave like a hermit in his cell. He had but little gold; but he knew how to make it welcome. And he had no other care than to be cognizant of all that happens: like the hermit, he was wrapped and hidden from the world.\n\nHis face was sad and very gentle, like that of one who is always brooding over an eternal problem, and who, when he meets a man, is gentle and forgetful of himself, because he is thinking only of the welfare of the other.\n\nAt first Episteme dwelt apart from men. They had called him mad because he had been seen going about like a sleepwalker; but a great thought had spoken to him: I am not mad, these are my wonderful days! He said nothing more than this: I am a tranquil eye that beholds the truths and the realities of life, and that secretly pities all men that are unhappy or erring. And now I go out among men again, as I used to do in my happy childhood. But I know about them beforehand; I have pondered over their greatness and their misery: perhaps they also have need of me.\n\nHe lived in the cave many years. People were astonished that he did not grow old; they thought him more strange than ever, but they respected him. He was always gentle, and spoke little. When he spoke, it was always about things that people did not understand. He told them what he had seen: the deep and marvelous things of their innermost souls. This made them afraid of him: they thought that perhaps after all he was not quite human; perhaps something even stranger than they had ever dreamed of might be hiding in his heart.\n\nBut they respected his wisdom and his poverty; they respected the fact that he never grew excited, and never criticized; on the other hand, he had a way of looking at people that was both tender and full of love. He always saw the truth; he also saw the beauty of what should be. He looked on men and things as they were and as they would be: he had learned pataphysical wisdom from what is most hidden in things and men. And the others respected this wisdom and respected his poverty, although they were very ignorant men themselves.\n\nOne day a small child was brought to him by some relations who happened to know that Episteme lived alone in his cave on the heights above Nisiera. The child was unlike any of those who used to play among the rocks and holes near Episteme's cave: it was a new-born babe, naked as Adam before His mother covered it with her handkerchief. It was a girl-babe. Episteme saw that she would bring no harm or sorrow to any one on earth, for she smiled continually as if at some secret joke which no one else could understand. And when Episteme took her into his arms he saw that she was like a little palm tree which grows straight up from the earth without bending down or turning, because its roots are in heaven: he saw that she would bring no harm or sorrow to any on earth as long as she lived. Episteme was filled with pity for the helpless creature, and with joy at his own happiness. And when later on people asked him about her he would smile as if at some secret joke which no one else could understand, but he would not answer a single word about her till somebody put a gold coin into his hand, which made him sigh deeply.\n\nAfter that he always took the babe to his cave when he went there to be alone. But whenever people saw Episteme coming through the valley with the child in his arms they always shouted at him, and when he came nearer they all laughed at him. And Episteme was sure that this happened because he had once been a man and had known the joys of love-making. That's what made him so serious, for humans are born in sin, just as birds are born in eggs. And Episteme used to say that human beings are all born in sin for no reason whatever, just as birds are born in eggs for no reason whatever. He was sure that when the last baby-egg is hatched and broken open, then all things will be put right again. For he believed firmly in something which many people nowadays do not believe--namely, that after the Last Judgment there will be some kind of sorting of the human race. But people like Episteme did not think about very much things--they were too busy with looking after their own happiness; that was why they never became bishops or archbishops or cardinals; but when they looked into their own hearts they always found something which it would be a relief to tell nobody about. If you like I can tell you something which happened to one of these silent saints.\"\n\"What?\" asked Time Ignorant.\n\"Well, once,\" said Death with a smile, \"I came upon Episteme walking through the valley.\"\n\"Yes? And what did you do?\" asked Time Ignorant.\n\"I?\" said Death in surprise. \"Nothing!\" Death laughed happily.\"'Do you know who I am?' Episteme asked quite calmly.\"\n\"No,\" said The Other One frankly.\n\"Then you're not very clever,\" said Episteme.\"Am I alive?\"\n\"Well, there's life and there's death,\" said The Other One. \"You're not dead.\"\n\"And have I been here for a long time?\" continued Episteme.\n\"I don't know about that either,\" answered The Other One. \"I've been waiting here for fifteen hundred years--and that might be just the same as for fifteen hundred million years.\"\n\"In other words,\" said Episteme, \"you can wait here a long time before anything happens?\"\n\"Yes,\" said The Other One with a smile, \"you can wait here a long time before anything happens.\"\nEpisteme smiled too and looked at his naked child who was sitting on the ground and laughing at them both with wide open eyes as if she found it all a great joke; then suddenly she began to cry as if she were hungry or wanted to go away somewhere else, but immediately afterwards she began to laugh again as if she had forgotten what she had been doing before and had seen something amusing which made her laugh; and her laughter sounded quite clearly over the rocks and holes down in the valley where it was repeated by another laugh from Episteme also heard quite distinctly from a distance. And Time Ignorant looked at his watch and saw that it was still only half past seven o'clock in the morning.\n\n'But what does it all mean?' asked Time Ignorant. 'You mean that we're waiting here for something and that means that we exist and therefore we must exist in a state of sin?'\n\"Yes,\" said Episteme, \"there's no getting away from it.\"\n\"I know,\" said The Other One, \"but how can one get out of it?\"\n\"One can't,\" answered Episteme. \"It's the same with you as with the baby: it screams and cries for something for which it has no use; and if someone gives it what it doesn't want, then it cries all the louder.\"\nThe baby was laughing again and pulling at Episteme's coat. He pushed her away a little crossly.\"Well?\" he asked.\n\"Are you quite sure that you exist?\" asked Time Ignorant.\n\"Yes, I am,\" answered Episteme.\"And have you been living here alone since the Last Judgment?\"\n\"Quite alone,\" said Episteme. \"I've brought nothing but happiness to other people, but I've known more unhappiness than any other living being--a great deal more.\"\n\"Tell me about it!\" said The Other One eagerly. \"Tell me about all your happiness! Why won't you tell me about your unhappiness? You know, I'm a doctor and a great deal more besides...\"\nEpisteme looked round as if he wanted to see whether anyone else were listening. Then he drew The Other One down beside him on to the ground and began to talk in a low voice as if he were afraid that even his own secret might be overheard.\"There's no one else here,\" he said, \"except my child. And she's left me--that's the only thing that's happened to me in all these centuries. She left me all by myself. She didn't leave me for any particular reason; she just went off somewhere else for no reason whatever; she didn't want anything, nor do I--we don't want anything. We've never wanted anything, not even when we were alive.\"\nDeath was silent for a little while after this; then he put his arm round Death's shoulders and kissed him on the cheek. Death went on talking with an undertone of irritating annoyance: \"We don't want anything! We don't expect anything! All her life she couldn't wait to be turned into nothingness; now that she has become nothingness she can't wait for anything else.\"\n\"What do you mean?\" asked Episteme anxiously. \"Don't you know what happened to her? Has she forgotten everything? Has she forgotten God? Has she forgotten everything since the Last Judgement? Is she still sitting there like an empty shadow? It is true that I haven't let her out of my sight for several hundred years now; but sometimes I think that perhaps she is sitting in some part of Heaven looking down at me always with an envious eye because I am still alive while she is dead. And sometimes also I think that perhaps instead of being dead she is still alive here below somewhere so lonely and abandoned as to care less about anything except herself.\" Then he added quietly: \"I don't believe there's anyone else anywhere who needs anything or wants anything either.\"\"But don't you feel lonely?\" asked The Other One gently.\"No, not now any longer,\" replied Episteme cheerfully. \"I always knew I would be left alone when the Last Judgment came along.\" And he smiled pleasantly as if he were already looking forward to the day when it would happen.\n\nDeath turned away from him in disgust.\"You're a morbid ass!\" he said. \"You've always been morbid. You've wanted to die for centuries and now you don't want to die any more. Get a grip on yourself!\"\n\"But I am so unhappy!\" cried Episteme, falling on his knees. \"I'm so unhappy, Death, so terribly unhappy!\"\nDeath kicked him aside like a bundle of old clothes.\"Get up!\" he said impatiently. \"Get up! Have you forgotten that it's my business to bring people present? You don't expect me to do it just because you happen to be unhappy, do you? That's not my line. Come on now, get up and stop talking rot!\" \nThen he seized the baby by the feet and dragged it over to the table, where it wailed louder than ever. Death brought over some milk in a jug and poured it into its opened mouth; it was immediately silenced and looked at him quite gratefully. Then Death turned back to Episteme.\n\"What are you doing down there?\" he asked.\n\"I'm praying,\" Episteme replied with great solemnity; \"for only half an hour more of life.\" \nDeath laughed with derision.\"Half an hour?\" he said. \"Try a million years!\" And he began dragging Episteme back towards the window again. But instead of doing as he was told Episteme pulled away from him and knelt down again on the floor of his own room with his arms round his knees and his face buried in his hands.\nDeath followed him, cursing with irritation. When they got there Episteme looked up at him appealingly, gently moving his arms as if to embrace him; then he slowly crept towards the window on all fours without letting go of Death's coat-tails, blinking tearfully with fear and hope. Death hesitated for a moment--then suddenly drew back, turned away from the window and went heavily to sit down in a chair on the other side of the room.\"Oh, all right,\" he said crossly. \"If you're going to be like that about it I might as well go away.\"\nAnd then he flung himself into a chair facing Episteme, but turned round so that he was looking into the dark recesses of the window instead of at him. A few seconds afterwards Episteme also turned round.\n\n\"What did you say?\" he snarled.\n\"I said it was a--a most curiously constructed house,\" stammered Episteme.\n\"You didn't!\" roared Death. \"You didn't!\"\n\"Yes I did,\" replied Episteme firmly. \"It is built like a--like a cube, but the walls slope inward as you go towards the top. And the roof starts off at a good thirty degrees from the ground, or thereabouts, and then after that it slopes back down to the ground again. And there are pillars going from each floor to the one above it and--oh dear!\" he added in dismay as Death began to roar and rage and shake his fists at him, \"I'm sorry, but it really is rather curious.\"\nDeath calmed down in a few seconds and looked thinkers over Episteme thoughtfully.\"Come on,\" he said at last, \"get up off your knees and stop babbling.\" Then he looked reflectively into the fire for a minute or two as if trying to think of something to say; but presently he looked up at Episteme again and asked, \"What do you think this house is for?\"\n\"House?\" said Episteme in some perplexity, getting slowly to his feet again. \"Well, I suppose it is meant to be a sort of temple or church--or perhaps a university--or something of that kind.\" \nDeath considered for a moment with his head on one side.\"Yes,\" he said at last, \"that's what it is.\" He lookedabsently at the ceiling for a minute or two as if he was trying whether there were any breaks in it; then suddenly he shouted, \"Come here!\" \nEpisteme hurried across the room withExcitement growing more and more intense inside him as Death waved him away from the window with his bony hand.\"Look there,\" said Death, pointing upwards into space, \"do you see anything up there?\"\nEpisteme squinted hard where Death was pointing.\"There seems to be something there,\" he answered cautiously. \"But it's very vague. It's just...a sort of...blackness....\" \nThen something entirely unexpected happened. The baby began to cry again, so violently that everyone in the room could hear it quite plainly; while simultaneously there came from outside sounds of crashing furniture, angry voices calling inconclusively to each other, running footsteps; they seemed to come from all directions at once....\n\nDeath turned round and looked at the fireplace. The fire had burned down to a few glowing embers.\"Come on,\" he said, \"let's have some proper lighting in here, if you don't mind. That darkness was getting really extremely irritating.\"He called out quite loudly to whoever might be in the room with him this time--\"Now, where did I put those matches?...\"\n\nIn a hole in the ground there lived a hobbit. Not a nasty, dirty, wet hole, filled with the ends of worms and an oozy smell, nor yet a dry, bare, sandy hole with nothing in it to sit down on or to eat: it was a hobbit-hole, and that means comfort. It had a perfectly round door like a porthole, painted green, with a shiny yellow brass knob in the exact middle. The door opened on to a tube-shaped hall like a tunnel: a very comfortable tunnel without smoke, with panelled walls, and floors tiled and carpeted, provided with polished chairs, and lots and lots of pegs for hats and coats\u2014the hobbit was fond of visitors. The tunnel wound on and on, going fairly but not quite straight into the side of the hill \u2014The Hill, as all the people for many miles round called it\u2014and many little round doors opened out of it, first on one side and then on another. No going upstairs for the hobbit: bedrooms, bathrooms, cellars, pantries (lots of these), wardrobes (he had whole rooms devoted to clothes), kitchens (he was rather proud of his cooking). The best rooms were all on the left-hand side (going in), for these were the only ones to have windows (well stuck together); natural light entered them through imitation skylights (quite transparent plastic) fastened by invisible brackets on the roof above them. His drawing-room was panelled throughout with yellow wood, and had a large ottoman in the centre--a very large one; so big that only he could have sat in it at one time. It also had four little low-backed chairs about it also.\n\nThe walls had some sort of light-coloured wallpaper, and the floor was covered with a rose-pink woollen carpet. This led into his study, which had the same general appearance as the drawing-room, only that it contained an even greater quantity of books. For whole walls were nothing but books; there were whole rooms on the top floor consisting only of one large room entirely covered with books; and in these rooms stood cases containing more books; and in these cases stood further cases containing more books; and so on. The ground floor of the house was let out to mechanics, who used it for their work.\n\nThis was Professor LUDWIG WOLFGANG FREDERIK, Dr.,philosophiae et philosophiae naturalisprofessor extraordinarius; in quo omnes insint qui Graeca Latine voluerint loqui\u2014et qui Latine Graeca voluerint loqui.\n\nThe Professor himself was a very small man, who hitherto had occupied no very elevated position in the world. He was in many respects singular in his character. He had never been intended for a professor, had not even been destined for a scholar or schoolmaster at all: how he came to be where he was nobody could tell. He did not know himself, any more than did his friend RUDOLF KEHRBACHER. He had been summoned thither by an impulse which he could not explain to himself, nor would he have attempted to explain it even to himself if at that moment he had not been perfectly certain that it was precisely his vocation in life to be sitting here in front of the door leading into the drawing-room, between two bundles of blue cotton quilts which filled the entire back part of the room.\n\nHe was sitting at his ease on one of the little low-backed chairs before his writing-table, with his feet extended forward on another low ottoman, holding in one hand an envelope over whose seal a few impressions still showed themselves with great distinctness\u2014and in the other hand a paperknife open on the table\u2014and was just going to start into activity when his eye fell upon an object which lay before him on this table also\u2014namely a large white envelope with a black cross and a silver cross round it: and then after remaining for another moment motionless and still as though petrifying, he jumped up from his chair and put both hands before his eyes. Then he walked straight to the glass door at his right hand and tore it open so violently that it made itself an echo through all the room: then immediately after that he sat down again on one of the little low-backed chairs before his writing-table and wrote for about twenty minutes so quickly that you might have heard all about it afterwards from each separate stroke he made on paper.\n\nAt last he also rose and went to the glass door, but with his eyes fixed upon the ground. He opened it wider than was necessary. He stood for a while listening outside. Then he went to his writing-table, took out a sheet of paper, and wrote something about twelve lines in large, firm letters which covered the whole sheet; then he walked slowly towards the door, looked out into the street, and closed it again behind him.\n\nHe was then already in the street, but he turned once more to look back at his home. The sun had sunk down below the horizon; but the upper part of the house was still lighted up by countless little red lights which each window let fall upon it like a golden spot; these lights were reflected in the mirror of Episteme\u2019s mind, in which they were also reflected as though they had been stars on some far-away horizon. And thus Episteme said to himself: \u201cYes, it is my own house!\u201d And he went away from it without looking back again.\n\n\nWhen Episteme had gone on his way for a time, he passed by a poor little cottage at the foot of a high mountain: there dwelt a lonely old man who was not deaf and worked hard all day for a living. Episteme found him quite ready to talk--perhaps even glad that his work had ended so that he could have some one to talk with. They sat down together on a low bench close against the wall of the house and asked one another who they were and from where they had come, as they knew each other already by sight: for there were many people about who knew one another by sight. In this way they began talking together of all sorts of things\u2014of life before death, and of death after death\u2014and about God and Heaven and Hell: be it never so well known that somewhere there is a Heaven and somewhere a Hell, there is nothing so easy as to talk about God and Heaven and Hell, even as though they were human beings like oneself; for such familiar conversation about God gives most Christian peace\u2014most Christian peace of mind.\n\nAnd thus spake Episteme to the old man: \u201cI am Episteme,\u201d said he; \u201cI live in this forest like an anchorite; but I am not mad: my madness is not like that which made this shepherd mad; nor yet like that which makes this sinner mad; no! I am not mad: I know my madness is different from theirs!\u201d\n\nAnd he told him how long ago he left the world and its miseries behind him: how for years he had lived with animals as their companion and friend; how since then he had walked through forests with those animals as guides\u2014through dark forests where no man may go; how divine dreams visited him there at times as they do now in our cities; how with animals as his companions he had grown friendly with them as friends with men. And then how everything became at length too much for him\u2014too great\u2014too great for his strength\u2014and then how all at once this new happiness too disappeared and left him lonely once more far away from men and animals alike: yes, both animals and men\u2014and thus became mad! Now once more after these many years he ponders over himself, over himself alone. He seeks no company other than himself\u2014and seeks it!\n\nAnd he tells you of his loneliness, and how his heart longeth for a comrade\u2014for a man or for an animal. And if he were not a coward he would roam with the animals in the forests one day, but he is a coward and will not do so. But perhaps he wants to see whether you are like him, whether you will return from your ego-splits into your truest selves, whether you will leave behind your ego-games one day and again love what is great in man. And he wishes to be with you.\n\nHe wishes to hear your voice: speak then! He wishes for the sound of your foot upon the wooden floor: walk then! He wishes for your hand in his\u2014take it! He wishes for tokens of love from you\u2014let him wring them from you! Or else take this kiss on the brow.\n\nFor he longs to hear these things even from thee, my brother.\n\nFor this he doth long\u2014for the joy of meeting him, of speaking with him, of living with him. Yea, even from thee.\n\nFor what is there in all the world that should not be given to him? Yea, verily, all things should be given unto him. But he hath consumed every thing else; and now he hath come back to make sure of this also.\n\nAnd thou wilt give it to him? Wilt thou not also then take this kiss on the brow? And dost thou not feel inclined rather to go away and leave him alone in his natural poverty and his divine solitude? For what is there now for thee to do here any more? Is not thy life a burden and a trouble?\n\nFor how wilt thou convert him back into the animal whence he came? How wilt thou lead him again into the kingdom of the animals? Has he not already become an animal in thine eyes?\n\nThou art deceiving thyself, my brother. He would go back only because otherwise he would sink down so low as to seek happiness at the hands of men. But canst thou be happy with that man who wisht for happiness of thee only? Wouldst thou not wish to reject that man? And surely thou wouldst reject him!\n\nFor once having tasted happiness thou wouldst look askance at the animal happiness which once was thine. But why should I talk here of animal happiness\u2014that is no joy for man\u2014that is merely animal. I shall tell thee rather what man alone can know, for it is this that hath happened unto thee: thou hast tasted thereby immortal joy! And thus thou knowest what man alone can know.\n\nAnd therefore I tell thee\u2014and even ye shall learn from me\u2014even though ye should still tread upon the backward paths, ye are still upon the forward path itself. The time will come when that forward path will be completely covered up, and if then ye turn aside, then life will no longer flow pure for you evermore!\n\n\n\u201cChildren of men! Do ye understand the commandment I give unto you? Do ye understand what is to be done by love? You want to know what it means to love one another: well, then! You must love yourselves first: it is necessary for you both, by your own acceptance, because without acceptance there can be no love either of you or of me,\u2013no more than there can be love on earth without first a certain inclination or disposition in you which makes you wish for one another\u2019s good.\u201d And then add further: \u201cYe must each see in another that which is good; and whatever things are good your love will seek after; and whatever things are evil your Hate will avoid. These two things must in some way or other grow together in one and inseparable; without Peace they cannot exist; without Love they cannot yet exist: they must in some way or other grow out of one and inseparable: if they do not thus grow out of one they cannot yet exist: and if they do not exist they cannot yet grow out of one and inseparable: if they do not grow out of one they cannot yet exist: and if they do not exist they cannot grow out of one and inseparable: if they do not grow out of one they cannot yet exist: and if they do not exist at all then neither can there be Peace neither can there be Love; but where there is no Peace there can also be no Love; where there is no Love there may yet be Peace; where there may yet be Peace there may yet be Love.\n\nIt is a law of mine, said Episteme, that man must find a way to his neighbour and do him good. But whither shall he find a way, and where does his duty lie, if not in the way which bringeth neighbour unto neighbour?\n\nTrue, said the people; there is no other way for man than that which bringeth neighbour unto neighbour. And that is right too: should it not be the law of every higher mammal to favour their neighbours as well as they favour themselves?\n\nBut where do we find neighbours and friends? you ask. I will tell you: above you, and over your heads, hang the stars. There was a time when they did not exist or did not shine. But there was a time when man found names for them, and grouped them in constellations, and knew their motions. This was the time when all things began to receive names. For there were still unreasoning beasts in those days who called themselves lions and tigers and sheep: these did Episteme call wild beasts. But some of them he also called Swallows and Owls. Thus men gave names even to rational creatures; but in their hearts they still felt like wild beasts. This is the origin of language:\u2014it was this that taught them to speak\u2014therefore they praise their language when they call it divine! For tongue and speech are always praised by them who understand them best: so it is reported to me. And man never yet lived so happily under another sky than he did then when he praised his own tongue: thus shall the Superman also praise his tongue!\n\nBut man has now caught up all the other animals; he hath made them subject to himself: therefore he is an overman; but he hath not yet found out what it is that can give him joy beyond joy. And I see a land before me where it will be well for him to dwell: one can well turn therefrom what might else make him weary. I see the future of man after we have removed the Superman from off his throne: then will it be an age of blessedness such as no other age can ever know!\n\nI tell you: I know MANY who were men long before me, Not one greater; but never one so great as MAN! \u2018Twas others who went into the woods to become apes of God,\u2014others like Will-o\u2019-the-Wisps who became fire-spirits or glow-worms; others again who followed heroes\u2014and these made us Gods for a little while! And we have let them go again each according to his kind; nothing but some fancy mocks left on our hands for a contemptible moment! They had their day once upon earth\u2014they had their time with us,\u2014and then one day they had to die.\n\nAnd then we knew them for what they were: apes and overmen! And then we knew the end of our overruling: it was man\u2014the monkey, the last monkey, who at the end of things would create for himself his Superman; and thus we grew weary, and said: Would God we had no longer any need of man! For he is a bad teacher. His lesson is now too difficult for us: he has drawn all good out of us, as from a cavity.\n\nAnd so I have been seeking those who have taught men better than man can teach them: but none have yet been found. I have looked among the beasts, and finally came to a lion. And when I saw him first, he was still a lion. He did not yet know that his power had become sufficient to let him roar,\u2014that he could fill a whole region with terror,\u2014that he could make men afraid of himself by his roars: for there was a time when this creature was not able to do this! This lion knew nothing about the use or power of his roaring; for this reason he did not know that after a few moments he would be changed into something else. And when I first saw him, he was a thousand times more terrible than anything that is tame! Yet even the lion, when he came from his jungle, and had left it behind him, was not immediately recognisable as a lion. Only many years later did they begin to think that they must have been changed into lions from somewhere near by! Thus is it also with man; what once seemed sensible does not seem sensible any longer; what was thought impossible in one world is thought possible in another; it is like children who can't tell whether their dream-world is real or whether it is what actually happens. Because men have learned to believe in themselves they believe in their dreams; they say they are real because they have seen them with their own eyes,\u2014they call their visions realities. And the things that most terrify them today are those that once inspired great terrors in them; but they are very close to us\u2014like shadows behind the wall!\n\nAnd oh if you should hear what these most modern men boast of! They boast of science, philosophy, logic, poetry\u2014these are their gods! And how do they worship these gods? Do they love them? No\u2014they hate them! What they really love is their own vanity about these gods,\u2014and that seems something terrible enough! For this vanity may be called great: it is great as long as one feels sure of its greatness; but when one begins to doubt oneself, then it does not become great any longer,\u2014as you will all know if you try it. As long as you are proud of your science and wisdom, you lay yourself open to all possible misfortunes\u2014for then you are ill! You must be ill to be proud of your science and wisdom,\u2014you must be sickly to be proud of anything at all!\n\nOnly consider how ridiculous it is to take yourself for something higher than other people (as the Germans did), or to take yourself for any kind of God! How would you like it, if your \u2018Thou\u2019 or your \u2018God\u2019 should call you, and then not be willing to come when he was called? Or if you had to be called in a loud voice (and that is the most ridiculous thing in the world)? Or if he should put out his hand like a soldier and take yours\u2014and that is the most ridiculous thing in all God\u2019s world! Or if he should try to touch you with his little finger,\u2014which is worse than with his fist! Or if he should want to kiss you,\u2014what would all the world say to that! It would be considered impudent in far less than six thousand years!\"\n\n\"But can one,\" asked Episteme, \"speak like this of the terrible progenitors of the race, of those beings who followed one another in chains, and in whose sight even trees were apes, and who in their senselessness commanded everything inanimate inanimate as animate,\u2014can one speak in this way of these holy relics of antiquity?\"\n\n\"You can very well speak of them,\" said the saint; \"for they have been more honourable men than you have ever been, and more worthy of honour: this old story gives them that right. And I too can speak of them, for I am a swan on the lake of your soul. But what I am able to tell thee of them is so poor! For I am not a friend of those old bowers from which twilight draws its light\u2014the mysteries where these growlings first hatched, from which all soul-mischief sprouts. In my home it is bright day out of doors: here no gloomy shades fly about my garden. With what gentle light I look on men and animals! Even with what soft beams I sometimes visit a sick child or a simple sheep! And oftentimes a tender mother will bring me home some young plant that she has tended through summer and winter. For since my youth I have known nothing but brooks and trees, flowers and butterflies,\u2014and birds know nothing either about those brooks, those flowers, those butterflies as I do. And as long as I found pleasure in looking at things as they are, as long as I felt any need to look at anything: that was my proper element. Thus do I understand those ancient ones: unmodern man felt something like SSLM. What then was SSLM? The free spirit and bird and flower and butterfly: what else was there?\"\n\n\"But,\" said Episteme, \"was there no one who was a greater than this bird of heaven\u2014that free spirit?\"\n\n\"There was,\" said the saint. \"But I do not want to speak of him. He is far too great for such a little song as I could sing. To be sure, I call myself his disciple and humble servant: but the masters are greater than their disciples, and they also still surpass their disciples.\"\n\nAnd thus spake the saint unto Episteme:\n\n\n\nI tell thee: he who seeketh out God, goeth among the greatest of the great: it is enough for him to pick out two or three who have worked nearest to the world's truth. But when he would create something new, then it is his best task to seek out that wherein all truths converge,\u2014that wherein God and man meet,\u2014a lamb with God in a soul with man. A new work must express both: the holy in man and the divine in the world must find their complement and harmony in a new holy and in a new divinity. And when such a lamb and such a god come together, if it be possible for them to co-operate, then there is no reason to despair: for what was holiest in all those old religions, what gave them their highest meaning\u2014the old saintly passive piety which knew even weakness as an expression of holy blessedness\u2014is once more awakened amongst men. And wherefore? Did he not himself teach us that one must believe only that which one can see? Did he not himself say that we should seek for ourselves first of all things\u2014\"there is no truth higher than my life\"? The saint too seeks his god where he can find him; his god does not come down from heaven; he seeks him first within his own soul.\"\n\n\"And whither goes he after God?\" asked Episteme. \"Go! go! you will not find him with your eyes! He is behind your eyes, whereby you see me!\"\n\n\"When thou speakest thus to me,\" said Episteme, \"I am again like unto the holy priest who has found his way into God's temple; like unto him who has entered upon forbidden ground. But follow me! Let us go over hill and valley; there ye shall find grass, flowers, butterflies; there are sheep both little and big; they do not understand you; they pass by like shadows; they let you come near them; there lies your life under their eyes,\u2014there lies your heart beneath their words. Go! go! you will never find God!\"\n\nAnd thus spake Episteme unto the saint: Then thou shalt count yourself among them too?\"\n\n\"Yes,\" answered the saint, \"for I too cannot help going along with them.\" What are they doing up there? They are building houses for God.\" And hereupon Episteme interrupted him sadly: \"There are still further tasks enjoined on me which I am nowise able to accomplish.\u2014But didst thou ever think of thine own self during all these years?\" As little could I have thought of it,\u2014said the saint,\u2014I had been thinking only of God.\" And hereupon again Episteme interrupted him sadly: \"But what thinkest thou? Can one think oneself away from oneself?\" And hereupon for the first time did Episteme smile.\u2014It is necessary however to say thus much to thee,\u2014said he,\u2014for otherwise thou wouldst depart from me altogether. The saint began again to build his house for God\u2014with whom he was willing to dwell,\u2014in which also Therese shall dwell,\u2014wherein also everything shall be well with her. But where wilt thou build thy house? said Episteme, laughing.\n\n\nA dangerous crossing-over; for when man is in the other, then he is not man any more: then, there is a good chance that it all goes to pieces.\n\nThe moment man tries to superman himself, he will make himself ridiculous.\n\nAnd he who would superman himself, must first be able to do without all the good things of the world, and to endure bad without complaining. He must be able to put up with strange men; he must be lonely; he must feel himself like the only man on earth. He must take on himself heavy burdens. And why? Because he has taken on himself the world, all that is over and done for, and has become strong. And now he can turn his back on it all, and go away into himself again.\n\nNow I know what you are thinking, and your thoughts are too bad for words! But let me tell you again: it takes strength to leave all that you have known; it takes strength to go over beyond,\u2014and this too is great happiness. To go beyond is easier than to go back or beyond; for before one can turn round one has already gone past it, where one thought it was at home,\u2014and could not go back,\u2014or was unable to find it.\n\nI tell you: he who goes with me need not fear the animals; they will not call him a coward. Not at my bidding will they come\u2014not at my call! They hear my voice but do not come. What they are belongs to me: what I make of them remains mine own. I am their lord and protector. But I am also their servant: they do whatever I sing in their ears.\n\nEpisteme has foreseen that man is entering into a new era in which his reason will no longer be the light by which he sees himself, but the herd will be the light by which he sees himself. And in this future era, Episteme says, there will come to him a man from another world; a man of the future. And this man will be his teacher. But he will not easily teach man how to superman himself. Man does not want to be taught; it is against his instincts. There are thousands of methods. Man has more than one way of making himself uncomfortable.\n\nThere are too many things\u2014and for all that it is only the herd that has to live on them! The burden is too heavy, too heavy! It can't be lifted off our shoulders any more; it is like an iron heaven that weighs us down. A burden on the back of an animal is nothing; think only of what it means to have a human back on your shoulders!\n\nAnd yet it is only when difference enters into the picture that any new world-order can begin to take shape, any new idea can take hold of us. It was precisely because men had become untrue to their origin and originator that they were unable to enter into this higher relationship with animals: their sense of difference was just what prevented them from getting in touch with animals.\n\nSomething in all of us isSahasraNa, something that is always looking out and seeing itself reflected in others and finding itself not there: we have the feeling that we are not really ourselves because we have lost ourselves along the way somewhere. We feel a sort of homeless exile within ourselves, and then we find a solace and consolation in being no longer ourselves outside as well as inside our selves: we seek a world where everything will be just as we once made it out to be for ourselves, where everyone will say \"Yes\" or \"No\", just as we ourselves do at home. We know how things stand with us within our own little circle, how different or alike men and women are to one another or how they stand with respect to other events and situations. And then we try to impose our point of view upon everyone else who exists beyond our circle: if a person speaks well of us, then he must also speak well of those other persons who are unknown to us personally; if he speaks ill of us, then he must also speak ill of those other persons who are unknown to us personally; if he likes this or that person, then he must also like those other persons who are unknown to him personally\u2014in short, all those who move within our circle must move together with us, as if they were our fellow creatures.\n\n# WORK IN PROGRESS\n#to-digest \n###\n"}

{"prompt": "Rationalism:", "completion": " #philosophy\n#knowledge \n#epistemology \n\n\n![[Drawing 2021-07-07 08.45.12.svg]]\n\n[[Edgar Morin]] (I believe) made me understood what is **rationalism**:\n\n>Science is based on both consensus and conflict. At the same time, it walks on four independent and interdependent legs: **rationality**, empiricism, imagination, verification. There is a permanent conflict between rationalism and empiricism; the empiricist destroys the **rational** constructions which are reconstituted from the new empirical discoveries\n\nSo it seems to be a process of [[Computing]] of the inputs received by the human machine. \nIt is now clear to me that very few people do that nowadays, because most people [[Mind]]s are full of the massive [[Noise]] emerging from [[The Internet]].\n\nWe also, sometimes, call it a priori [[Philosophy/Epistemology/Knowledge]]?\n\n[[Philosophy/Mind/Mental Model/Exploration vs exploitation]] is an analogy of **rationalism** vs [[Empiricism|empiricism]]\n\n[[Russell]] said \n>We perceive hard and soft through touch, but it is the mind that judges that they exist and that they are contraries. Only the mind can reach existence, and we cannot reach truth if we do not reach existence. It follows that we cannot know things through the senses alone, since through the senses alone we cannot know that things exist. Therefore knowledge consists in reflection, not in impressions, and perception is not knowledge, because it 'has no part in apprehending truth,\nsince it has none in apprehending existence'\n\nAs from a [[Computing]] mindset, it seems that [[Philosophy/Epistemology/Knowledge]] is about input from the different senses plus data processing of the whole machinery.\n\nSenses and the brain aggregate into a [[Society of Minds]].\n\nWe says mathematical logic is devoid of empirical information but where the thought of numbers come from?\nWhen a child is born, without any culture yet, he can still count, is it a [[Philosophy/Epistemology/Knowledge]] given by God? No, it is just our ancestors that needed to know when there is 1, 2 or 3 lion, 1, 2, or 3 mammoth in order to survive, thus [[Mathematic]] got imprinted in our genes.\nWhat is called **rationalism** seems to be our natural [[Philosophy/Epistemology/Knowledge]], ancients probably did not understand this because of the lack of advances in [[Biology]] and the [[Philosophy/Epistemology/Knowledge]] of the theory of [[Evolution]] by natural selection.\n\n\nApparently [[Plato]] was dogmatically arguing that [[Philosophy/Epistemology/Knowledge]] can only be acquired through **rationalism**, i.e. that the inputs from the senses are of no value in that inquiry.\n\nI disagree, and I think it has entered our culture that [[Philosophy/Epistemology/Knowledge]] can only be acquired by [[Empiricism]] since probably [[Locke]].\n\n[[Mathematic]] is written in our [[Genome]]:\n\n>The genesis of mathematical invention is a problem that should be of the greatest interest to the psychologist. It is the act in which the human [[Mind]] seems to **borrow the least from the external world**, where it acts or seems to act only by itself and on itself, so that by studying the process of geometrical thought, it is what is most essential in the human [[Mind]] that we can hope to reach. ~ [[Poincare]]\n\n[[Mathematic]] [[Business/Entrepreneurship/Innovation]] is largely due to **rationalism**:\n\n>These are the facts, and here are the reflections that they imply to us. The **unconscious self** or, as one says, the **subliminal self** plays a capital role in the mathematical invention, that results from all that precedes. ~ [[Poincare]]\n\n\n# The mind as a mailbox ![[The mind as a mailbox]]\n\n>\u2013 Which type of rationality should be considered to be the only correct one?\n\u2013 Is it possible to use reason for everything and in all areas of life or should it be used selectively? If so, how can this selective approach be implemented? Should a person give up some parts of life at the expense of others? What should he/she do then if there is no single area that allows him/her to win with ease by using reason alone? When it comes to science \u2013 which part cannot be handled by rational thinking and where does intuition take over\u2026 especially when one tries to explain complex phenomena involving both physical and metaphysical issues as well as relationships between human beings. How can these different areas coexist without causing contradictions or mutual exclusivity instead of complementing each other (which would seemingly make more sense)?\nWhat will happen when we reach very specific points in research where our current knowledge ends and further progress requires people who think differently than just through logical reasoning - namely philosophers or artists...(somehow I feel that art will have a much larger role later on).. **This question makes me wonder whether some kind of division into thinkers (scientists) and feelers (artists & philosophers) might not become necessary at some point.** Because isn't there something like an imbalance between these two groups now with scientists greatly outnumbering those who express themselves artistically without necessarily being aware about what they are doing...or maybe even against them because they don't understand why anyone would need art anyway since science gives us answers while art merely provides beautiful colors around those dry bones.... But this issue could also mean something else, namely the fact that humanity seems unable \\[to solve certain problems\\] right now due its obsession with using logic only which limits itself too much within various dogmas instead looking from outside their framework. Of course there's always room for improvement but shouldn't we first try not limiting ourselves from using other methods such as creativity before concluding what works best; although sometimes one has no choice but following someone else whose view seems more clear than ours?\" \n__ [[GPT3]]\n\nNo, gpt3, [[Philosopher]] are thinkers too, not \"feelers\".\nBut I understand. [[GPT3]] is trained on [[The Internet]], so what gpt3 says is the aggregate of what people think.\nSo, most people see [[Philosophy]] as a illogical, art-like, activity.\nIt is actually pretty sad for [[Philosophy]] is the root of [[Philosophy/Epistemology/Knowledge|knowledge]], thus they are completed ignorant.\n[[Philosophy]] is what brings [[Logic]] in our thoughts.\n\n# Tools\n\n- [[Socratic method]]\n- [[Epistemic justice]]\n- [[Induction]]\n- [[Deduction]]\n###\n"}

They optimize the parameters $\\theta$ either directly by gradient ascent on the performance objective $J(\\pi_{\\theta})$. This optimization is almost always performed [[On-Policy]]\n\n[[Soft Actor Critic]] \n- performs gradient ascent to directly maximize performance\n\n[[Proximal Policy Optimization]]\n- updates indirectly maximize performance, by instead maximizing a surrogate objective function which gives a conservative estimate for how much $J(\\pi_{\\theta})$ will change as a result of the update\n\n**Q-Learning**. Methods in this family learn an approximator $Q_{\\theta}(s,a)$ for the optimal action-value function, $Q^*(s,a)$. Typically they use an objective function based on the [[Bellman Equation]]. This optimization is almost always performed [[Off-Policy]]\n\n[[Deep Q Network]]\n- launched the field of deep RL\n\nC51\n- learns a distribution over return whose expectation is $Q^*$\n\n[Equivalence Between Policy Gradients and Soft Q-Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/1704.06440)\n\n# Model based\n\n**TODO: filter out**\n\nThere are many orthogonal ways of using models. In each case, the model may either be given or learned.\n\n**Pure Planning**. The most basic approach never explicitly represents the policy, and instead, uses pure planning techniques like [model-predictive control](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Model_predictive_control) (MPC) to select actions.\n\nThe [MBMF](https://sites.google.com/view/mbmf) work explores MPC with learned environment models on some standard benchmark tasks for deep RL.\nExpert Iteration. A straightforward follow-on to pure planning involves using and learning an explicit representation of the policy, \\pi_{\\theta}(a|s). The agent uses a planning algorithm (like Monte Carlo Tree Search) in the model, generating candidate actions for the plan by sampling from its current policy. The planning algorithm produces an action which is better than what the policy alone would have produced, hence it is an \u201cexpert\u201d relative to the policy. The policy is afterwards updated to produce an action more like the planning algorithm\u2019s output.\n\nThe ExIt algorithm uses this approach to train deep neural networks to play Hex.\nAlphaZero is another example of this approach.\nData Augmentation for Model-Free Methods. Use a model-free RL algorithm to train a policy or Q-function, but either 1) augment real experiences with fictitious ones in updating the agent, or 2) use only fictitous experience for updating the agent.\n\nSee MBVE for an example of augmenting real experiences with fictitious ones.\nSee World Models for an example of using purely fictitious experience to train the agent, which they call \u201ctraining in the dream.\u201d\nEmbedding Planning Loops into Policies. Another approach embeds the planning procedure directly into a policy as a subroutine\u2014so that complete plans become side information for the policy\u2014while training the output of the policy with any standard model-free algorithm. The key concept is that in this framework, the policy can learn to choose how and when to use the plans. This makes model bias less of a problem, because if the model is bad for planning in some states, the policy can simply learn to ignore it.\n\nSee I2A for an example of agents being endowed with this style of imagination.\n\n###\n"}

The other direction, which is less familiar, proceeds, by analysing, to greater and greater abstractness and logical simplicity; instead of asking what can be defined and deduced from what is assumed to begin with, we ask instead what more general ideas and principles can be found, in terms of which what was our starting-point can be defined or deduced.

And the answer in my experience is no and actually the inverse in the first stages.<br /><br />The author thus asserts that carbohydrates, by stimulating insulin, lead to the accumulation of fats that eventually lead to obesity.<br />So obviously author tends to be pro ketogenic diet, it's a very controversial diet nowadays, some say our bodies didn't evolve to handle such a diet, some says the inverse.
