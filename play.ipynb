      "      \"text\": \" Have you ever thought about mathematics as a fundamental element of our society?\\nYou can see that when we try to talk about math with other people, they tend to be bored and we end up talking about something else. But actually the mathematical ideas are really important in everyday life. For example, what is your current salary? It's obvious that it depends on how many hours you work per week or month, but do you think if there was no division by 7 (or 40) would affect the real world? This question will probably give an interesting conversation because for most people this idea is new and very curious.\\n2. Do you know who invented numbers ?\\nMany mathematicians have been working throughout history trying to understand why some numbers are more useful than others and how these came into being . Answering this questions may lead us to good discussions on the nature of existence and artificiality of science . We could also find similarities between mathematics and music , which is another topic very related with numbers . The objective here isn't just knowledge; I believe knowing things helps develop reasoning skills , not only memorizing information from books or internet articles. 3. Have you ever heard of prime numbers ? What do they mean ? Prime number s are natural number s greater than 1 whose only positive divisors are itself \\u00a0and 1 : 2 , 3 , 5 , 7 , 11 \\u2026 A simple way to explain them in a short way: \\u00a0prime number s can easily be divided into equal groups without any remainder : 4 = 2 * 2 8 = 4 * 2 16 = 8 * 2 32 = 16*2 64= 32*2 128= 64*32 256=128*16 512=256*32 1024=(256+64)*16 2048=(128+64)*(16\\u00d74) 4096=(256+64)(8\\u00d74) \\u00d7(1+(8)) 2401609600896144000245760000\\u2026 So primes look like single unbreakable structures since they cannot be split among several parts (without leaving any remainder). You might ask yourself now: \\\"What kind of use does having prime number s has?\\\" One fun thing with prime numbe rs is that they appear all over nature: Primes never repeat themselves so each whole number can be uniquely described using just their digits \\u00a0 - No matter how far out one goes in measuring distances along straight lines each distance will always fall under one specific prime \\u00a0 - Einstein proved that every atom consists purely out energy\"\n",
