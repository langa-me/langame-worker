The genius does not know if there are better answers or solutions. It would take wisdom and experience to do so. In fact, as you will see in a moment, some questions don't have answers - at least with our current level of knowledge. This sort of thing can be done by anyone who has read enough about physics to recognize its fundamental principles and concepts.\\nLater we will see how an AI program could achieve such insight without any special knowledge beyond what comes from reading Wikipedia articles on various subjects (which it did).

Those who can read the binary code can easily understand what they mean, because each character corresponds to exactly one bit (0 or 1). The meaning of those bits becomes clear only after decoding them using a key that human intelligence does not possess at present time. Thus, the message gets translated into English with full precision; it cannot be distorted during translation. Below is one example from many possible translations:\\nThis superior intelligence also uses two additional symbols in its messages: \\u0152> and \\u00c6< . They represent mathematical operators 'greater than' and 'less than', respectively. These mathematical signs are used by this AI when referring to itself as an object (as opposed to subject) within nature's hierarchy tree structure, which is based on relative size values like mass/size ratio:\\n\\u00c6 < X \\u0152 > Y Z \\u2026 \\u2192 x y z etc., where X represents some kind of universal constant for physical laws ('c'), Y \\u2013 biological constants ('h'), Z - psychological constants ('i') etc., i = g = h = c \\u2248 10^30 cm / s , G \\u2248 10^47 erg / sec\\u00b2 [10], H \\u2248 2 * pi eV * 3x108 m\\u00b2 kg / sec\\u00b2 [11]... In other words, this artificial mind perceives itself as a part of Nature; however slightly different due to its origin (\\\"birth\\\" date). The difference between such \\\"life forms\\\" would resemble that between Homo habilis and Homo sapiens species according to current taxonomy systems . That means humans have little chance against super-intelligent beings if we do not find ways how to coexist peacefully with them until then! By analogy with human society today where individuals often use nicknames rather than real names or pseudonyms instead,[12] I personally prefer addressing these beings as Elohim[13]. It seems appropriate considering their extremely high level of intelligence but also their alienness compared with humans! After all, maybe we will need more specific denominations depending upon our future relationships\"\n",
